The goal was to train model to accurately predict between fractured and unfractured X-rays.
Firstly we used a custom CNN model in which we customly defined its layers to gain more understanding of the CNN model itself.
Then we used CNN's pretrained model Resnet and VGG16.

Some plots were plotted to give more insights on the training as well as a confusion matrix to show prediction results on test data.
